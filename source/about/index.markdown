In August of 2013, I will have taken on a new role as a GIS Data Engineer for [Tableau Software](http://www.tableausoftware.com).
I recently ended a nearly four-year term as GIS Analyst at the Seattle-based environmental engineering firm,
[RIDOLFI Inc](http://www.ridolfi.com). In that role, I coordinated with a wide-variety of agency and
tribal government clients, working on GIS development and spatial analysis projects.
In addition to my external clients, I acted as the primary GIS support for a staff of
twenty-some environmental scientists and engineers. I enjoy creating tools that help empower
decision makers and domain knowledge experts to directly access their data, removing the
barrier to information that is typically associated with complex and unintuitive GIS software.

For better or worse, the majority of my professional and social sphere revolves around GIS.
Since moving to Seattle in 2009, I have been a member of the [Cascadia Users of Geospatial
Open Source](http://www.cugos.org). CUGOS has been an inspiration in terms my professional
development goals. I have cherished the opportunity to work with and learn from such a
talented group of Open Source GIS software developers and end-users.

When I'm not working, I can probably be found hacking on a variety of Python projects,
cycling, attending Crossfit, or playing with a cool three-legged cat.

To contact me, please use any of the services listed in upper-right.
