Just found out that I'll be participating in the 2009 ESRI UC as a student assistant. Big thanks go out to [Dr. Robert Balling](http://geography.asu.edu/balling) and [James Fee](http://www.spatiallyadjusted.com/), who both wrote letters of recommendation for me.

Now to get back to more pressing matters, like refactoring this giant wad o' javascript. <!-- more -->

See you in San Deigo!
